## Use case <a name="usecase"/>

As a Salesforce admin, I want to have my users synchronized between two different Salesforce organizations

## Template overview <a name="templateoverview"/>

Let's say we want to keep Salesforce instance *A* synchronized with Salesforce instance *B*. Then, the integration behavior can be summarized just with the following steps:

1. Ask Salesforce *A*:
> *Which changes have there been since the last time I got in touch with you?*

2. For each of the updates fetched in the previous step (1.), ask Salesforce *B*:
> *Does the update received from A should be applied?*

3. If Salesforce answer for the previous question (2.) is *Yes*, then *upsert* (create or update depending each particular case) B with the belonging change

4. Repeat previous steps (1. to 3.) the other way around (using *B* as source instance and *A* as the target one)

 Repeat *ad infinitum*:

5. Ask Salesforce *A*:
> *Which changes have there been since the question I've made in the step 1.?*

And so on...
  
  
The question for recent changes since a certain moment in nothing but a [poll inbound][1] with a [watermark][2] defined.


# Run it! <a name="runit"/>

In order to have the template up and running just complete the two following steps:

 1. [Configure the application properties](#propertiestobeconfigured)
 2. Run it! ([on premise](#runonopremise) or [in Cloudhub](#runoncloudhub))


## Properties to be configured<a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>

### Application configuration
+ polling.frequency `10000`  
This are the miliseconds (also different time units can be used) that will run between two different checks for updates in Salesforce

+ watermark.default.expression `2014-02-25T11:00:00.000Z`  
This property is an important one, as it configures what should be the start point of the synchronization.The date format accepted in SFDC Query Language is either *YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm* or you can use Constants. [More information about Dates in SFDC](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/officetoolkit/Content/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_dateformats.htm)

### SalesForce Connector configuration for company A
+ sfdc.a.username `jorge.drexler@mail.com`
+ sfdc.a.password `Noctiluca123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`
+ sfdc.a.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/28.0`

### SalesForce Connector configuration for company B
+ sfdc.b.username `mariano.cozzi@mail.com`
+ sfdc.b.password `LaRanitaDeLaBicicleta456`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`
+ sfdc.b.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/28.0`



## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>

Running the template on CloudHub is as simple as follow the 4 steps detailed on the following documetation page: 
  
> [http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub)

## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
Once all properties are filled in one of the template property files (for example in [mule.prod.properties](https://github.com/mulesoft/template-sfdc2sfdc-user-bidirectional-sync/blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties)) the template can be run by just choosing an enviromet and follow the steps detailed in the link placed below:

# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organised by describing all the XML that conform the template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
This file holds the configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. 
**Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** 
Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
It is intented to define the application API.
...

## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
This file holds the functional aspect of the template , directed by one flow responsible of conducting the business logic.
...


## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
This is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions. 
This file holds a [Choice Exception Strategy](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Choice+Exception+Strategy) that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
